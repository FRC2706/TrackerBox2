TODO list going into the 2016 season with Team 2706.

Web inferface tasks [Mike + Matt]:


- [Matt] : add a toggle on the web interface for "IP Axis Cam" or "USB Cam" ... or just hard-code the priority: 1) USB Cam, 2) Axis Cam, 3) Laptop Cam

- [Mike] When changing the Pi's IP address, apache will need sudo power (or at least sudoers priviledge on `ifconfig` and `reboot`)

- [Matt] On the web page, have a button "Settings" which takes you to a page with "Team Number", and IP addresses for "RPi IP", "AxisCam IP", and "RoboRio IP" (all defaulting to 10.TE.AM.___ but completely editable)

- [Matt] Have a "Downscale" dropdown menu on the web interface?

- [Matt] fps on the interface




c++ code tasks [Mike / Kevin, Matt / Morgan]:


- [Mike + Matt / Morgan] : clean up code (open-source quality commenting, etc) and remove old or unused files.
	
- [Mike + Matt / Morgan, high priority] update code to use the libyaml0.5 api, if they take libyaml0.3 off the ubuntu repos, we're in trouble.

- [Mike, low priority] : Update all the opencv data structures and function calls to the c++ api. (currently it's a mashup of the c and c++ api's)

- [Morgan] Optimize frame-rate by reducing image resolution?


With cRIO:
- test and update Java wrapper
- write & test c++ wrapper
- write & test LabView wrapper

Notes for Pi image setup:
-needs permissions for cgi-bin scripts
-default user needs permission to own services in dbus SystemBus
-apache user needs permission to run methods over SystemBus


Stuff that's Done! :
