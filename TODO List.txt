Things TODO on this project:

- [Mike] : clean up code (open-source quality commenting, etc) and remove old or unused files.
	
	- [Mike or Alex] : Update all the opencv data structures and function calls to the c++ api. (currently it's a mashup of the c and c++ api's)

	- [Mike] : Still need to clean up / comment networkTracker.cpp

- [Alex] : add a toggle on the web interface for "IP Axis Cam" or "USB Cam" ... or just hard-code the priority: 1) USB Cam, 2) Axis Cam, 3) Laptop Cam

- [Mike / Alex] : Add the opencv Hue rainbow to the sliders

- Test on different boards?

- On the web page, have a button "Settings" which takes you to a page with "Team Number", and IP addresses for "RPi IP", "AxisCam IP", and "RoboRio IP" (all defaulting to 10.TE.AM.___ but completely editable)

- Optimize frame-rate by reducing image resolution?


Features to add (feel free to add items Alex)
- fps on the interface
- multiple colours ranges in one profile? (have a button to add a additional colour, can do this an arbitrary number of times ?)

- [Alex] : Think up a way to set the ip of the rpi to the team number, ie 10.XX.YY.28 or something, without the user having to put a monitor on the rpi.
	- maybe the image we ship has it default to 192.168.0.20 and the first time you connect to the web interface it prompts you for your team number?
	- can we find a better way?




With cRIO:
- test and update Java wrapper
- write & test c++ wrapper
- write & test LabView wrapper

Notes for Pi image setup:
-needs permissions for cgi-bin scripts
-default user needs permission to own services in dbus SystemBus
-apache user needs permission to run methods over SystemBus


Stuff that's Done! :

- (DONE!) [Mike] : HSV wrap-around (ie if min > max then take everything < max and > min)
- (DONE!: turned out not to help) [Mike] : get rid of as many loops as possible by replacing them with matrix (linear algebra) operations.
- (DONE!) [Mike] : rm networkTracker.*; mv networkTracker_withServer.* -> networkTracker.*
- (DONE!) [Mike] : save yaml files and images (raw + backproj + anything else) to file in /tmp at each frame
- (DONE!) [Alex] : write a web interface that mirrors the opencv interface
