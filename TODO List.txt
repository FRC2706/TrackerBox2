Things TODO on this project:

- [Alex] : write a web interface that mirrors the opencv interface
	- [Mike] : save yaml files and images (raw + backproj + anything else) to file in /tmp at each frame

- [Mike] : clean up code (open-source quality commenting, etc) and remove old or unused files.

- [Mike] : get rid of as many loops as possible by replacing them with matrix (linear algebra) operations.

- [Alex] : add a toggle on the web interface for "IP Axis Cam" or "USB Cam"


Features to add (feel free to add items Alex)
- fps on the interface
- multiple colours ranges in one profile? (have a button to add a additional colour, can do this an arbitrary # of times ?)

- [Alex] : Think up a way to set the ip of the rpi to the team number, ie 10.XX.YY.28 or something, without the user having to put a monitor on the rpi.
	- maybe the image we ship has it default to 192.168.0.20 and the first time you connect to the web interface it prompts you for your team number?
	- can we find a better way?




Future:
- test and update Java wrapper
- write & test c++ wrapper
- write & test LabView wrapper
