Things TODO on this project:

- [Alex] : write a web interface that mirrors the opencv interface
	- [Mike] : save yaml files and images (raw + backproj + anything else) to file in /tmp at each frame
- [Mike] : clean up code (open source quality commenting, etc) and remove old or unused files.


Features to add (feel free to add items Alex)
- fps on the interface
- multiple colours ranges in one profile? (have a button to add a additional colour, can do this an arbitrary # of times ?)



Future:
- test and update Java wrapper
- write & test c++ wrapper
- write & test LabView wrapper
